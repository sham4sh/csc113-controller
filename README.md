# csc113-controller

Final project for CSC113; this repository contains the codebase for a wireless control system for an electronic bike using two ESP32 microcontrollers with Arduino framework.

The system consists of an onboard computer with several attached sensors, communicating with a remote controller via an MQTT server. Full schematics will be available soon.
